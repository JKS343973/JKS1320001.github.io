# About Me
Hello! I am Chuko.
I've always wanted to become a mechanic becasue of how I was able to make it one of my best skills I have so far and one day to make use of thoes skills and make them  more profeincent. Being a mechanic has a lot of different kind of jobs from submarines to planes, but being an airplane mechanic has been a passion of mine since I was very young.
